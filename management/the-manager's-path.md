# **Management 101:**

**What to expect from Manager:**

- A manager who can help you to focus, can help you grow in your career. Who can help you in making decision.

Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.  Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday. managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus. 

One-on-One meetings:

1-1s serve two purposes. First, they create human connection between you and your manager. Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes, and will hopefully care enough to ask you about it.

2nd purpose is it gives you a opportunity to talk privately with your manager.

Come with an agenda of things you would like to discuss.

**Feedback and Workplace Guidance**

The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct. Ideally, the feedback you get from your manager will be somewhat public if it’s praise, and private if it’s criticism. 

Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something. If you don’t ask your manager about a promotion, do not expect her to just give you one magically.  It’s great when managers can identify and assign stretch projects that will help us grow and learn new.  Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work. The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of the company.

**Career and growth:**

Try to find people to work for who push you to succeed but also reward you for success, who inspire you to stretch yourself. They are often the technical cofounders of startups. If you want to go down that path, the best thing to do is to work for a company that has a track record of people who have left it to found new companies. This is where you will meet your future cofounders and discover opportunities to get into new companies early.”

**Spend Time Thinking About What You Want:**

the workplace or 20 years into your career, the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on your shoulders. Use your manager to discover what’s possible, where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next.” 

**You Are Responsible for Yourself.** 

Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want. Bring agendas to your 1-1s when you have things you need to talk about. Seek out feedback, including constructive feedback on areas to improve. When that feedback comes to you, take it graciously, even when you don’t agree with it. When you want a promotion, find out what you need to do to get it. You will not get everything you ask for, and asking is not usually a fun or comfortable experience. 

if you’ve set a goal for yourself, you owe it to yourself to do what you can to make it happen.

**Give your manager a break**

Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems. When you have a problem, instead of demanding that your manager solve it for you, try asking her for advice on how she might approach the problem. Asking for advice is always a good way to show respect and trust.

**Choose your manager wisely**

What did your manager do that you found valuable? 

- Has your manager delivered good feedback to you? Bad feedback? Any feedback at all?
- Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?

**Gist:** Build strong communication skills and strong networks. Spend time thinking about what do you want and what you want to achieve. Your life and career is in your hand, manager can just give direction. if you’ve set a goal for yourself, you owe it to yourself to do what you can to make it happen.

# Mentoring:

**Listen carefully**

Listening is the first and most basic skill of managing people.

Listening is a precursor to empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager.

So, when your mentee is speaking to you, pay attention to your own behavior.

One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand. And remember that you’re in a position of huge power in your mentee’s eyes.

**Clearly communicate**

Work on another management skill: communicating what needs to happen. 

You got to practice listening, communicating, and adjusting. 

### Mentoring a New Hire

A more subtle unspoken rule dictates approximately how long you are expected to struggle with something by yourself before asking someone else to help you. 

Companies are full of human networks that exist to transmit knowledge and information quickly. Bringing this person into some of your networks will help her get up to speed faster, and it will give you a new entree into whatever networks she ends up forming and joining in her time with the company. People planning on staying with the same company for a long time, particularly in large companies, often find opportunities via informal networks. Your mentee may someday be on a team that you are interested in joining, or you may someday want to bring her into a team you are running in another area. The workplace is built around humans and their interactions, and these networks form the basis of any career, whether it’s focused on management or individual technical contributions. 

Adopt the mindset that network building is a worthwhile investment of your time and energy.

**Technical or Career Mentoring**

Practicing the art of teaching can help us learn how to nurture and coach, how to phrase things so that others will listen, instead of just shouting them down. 

**Tips for the Manager of a Mentor**

What you measure, you improve. As a manager you help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals. When you need to assign a mentor for your new hire or intern, figure out what you’re hoping to achieve by creating the relationship. leadership requires human interaction to exist. Developing patience and empathy is an important part of the career path of anyone working in a team-based environment.

Key takeaways for mentor:

- **Be focus and open minded** - Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes. new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on these hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.” Patterns like you know but don’t know how to explain to others. Opportunity to review the questions might be worth questioning. It’s a way to find things which are hidden to others/you
- Listen and speak their language - mentoring forces you to hone your communication skills. To work successfully with a newcomer or a more junior teammate, you must be able to listen and communicate in a way that person can understand, even if you have to try several times to get it right. Software development is a team
- Make connections - Your career ultimately succeeds or fails on the strength of your network. Mentoring is a great way to build this network. You never know. On the flip side, don’t abuse the mentoring relationship. Whether you’re in the mentor’s seat or acting as the mentee, remember that your career is long and the tech world can be very small, so treat the other person well.

# Tech lead

**What is the job of tech lead, really?**

Tech lead has to continue to write code, but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the project management process. 

Tech lead is expected to be both a technical position and a leadership role, and that it is often a temporary set of responsibilities rather than a permanent title.

L4 responsibilities:

- Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases
- Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted
- Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring
- If a tech lead is not managing directly, they are still expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the other members of the team
- The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging.
- They are empowered to make independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult management and leadership situations.
- They are learning how to partner effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business
- A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team.”
- Tech leads are in the position to act as strong technical project leaders, and to use their expertise at a larger scale so that their whole team gets better.

**Being a tech lead:**

Being a tech lead is an exercise in influencing without authority. How do I empower them? How do I remove the obstacles slowing them down? Working on a rewrite, or some new exciting feature that helped me express the full extent of my technical prowess, might have been more fun, but what the team needed at the time was to tackle technical debt and to focus on operations. 

***The tech lead is expected to make sure the team fully understands the project requirements, the work is planned, and the team is effective and performing well, all without necessarily having any management responsibilities and usually without any specific training.***

**Managing Projects:**

**Taking the time to explain:**

They learn to trust my judgment and advice, and we bring about change. Taking the time to explain is very important. Explanation educates team without making them feel small.

## How to be a great tech lead?

- **Understand the architecture**
- Be a team player
- **Lead technical decisions:**
    
    Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve. In all of these cases, make it clear what the matter under discussion is, and communicate the outcome.
    
- Communicate
    
    “Don’t forget to listen during all of this communication. Give others a chance to speak, and hear what they say. Practice repeating things back to people to ensure you understand them. Learn how to hear what someone says and rephrase it in your own words. 
    
    # Managing people
    
    - Find out your management style
    - Tasks required to manage people:
        - Taking on a new report
        - Holding regular 1-1s
        - Giving feedback on career growth, progression toward goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted
        - Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring
        
    
    How do you get to know this person quickly so you can manage him best?
    
    **Create a 30/60/90-Day Plan**
    
    Another approach that many experienced managers use is to help their new reports create a 30/60/90-day plan. This can include basic goals, like getting up to speed on the code, committing a bug fix, or performing a release, and is especially valuable for new hires and
    people transferring from other areas of the company.
    
    You want him to have some clear goals that will show whether he’s learning the right things as he gets up to speed.
    
    Create a set of realistic milestones based on your prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in.
    
    **Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation**
    

**The To Do List meeting:**

Use a shared Google spreadsheet to keep a running list of topics for discussion that both he and his reports had access to, so each could add to the list whenever a thought came up, and they would review it during the 1-1. It also gave both parties a chance to see what was on the other’s mind before the 1-1 happened, so that they could prepare.

Make it clear to team member what the goals are and what her responsibilities are, and provides support and guidance to help them succeed.

Trust and control are the main issues around micromanagement.

When you’re delegating responsibility, you’re still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed.

Example: Sharell didn’t just abandon Beth — she helped Beth understand the responsibilities in the new role and was there as needed to support the project.

**Use the Team’s Goals to Understand Which Details You Should Dig Into**

How do you decide when to ask for this information to begin with? My philosophy is simple: if the team is making progress on its goals, the systems are stable, and the product manager is happy, I rarely dig into the details beyond a cursory overview.

**Gather Information from the Systems Before Going to the People**

**Adjust Your Focus Depending on the Stage of Projects**

**Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Neutral to Positive Way.**

The goal here isn’t to punish him with micromanagement for his failure to communicate status, because all you’re doing is punishing yourself and hindering his ability to be held accountable for his own work. Instead, Your goal is to teach Jack what he needs to communicate, when, and how. 

Hiding important information intentionally is a failure, and getting stuck on a problem or making a mistake is often just an opportunity for learning. In the long run, if you don’t figure out how to let go of details, delegate, and trust your team, you’re likely to suffer personally.

Your team deserves a manager who is willing to trust them to do things on their own.

**Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback**

You have a lot of power to shape the experience your direct reports have with reviews. Continuous feedback is, more than anything, a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback. Instead of saving these kinds of comments for the review cycle, managers and peers are encouraged to note when things are going well and raise issues as they happen.

You’re also practicing the art of having small and occasionally tricky conversations with individuals about their performance. 

- **Know your people:**

“What are their goals, if any? What are their strengths and weaknesses. where might they need to improve to get to the next level? This understanding gives you a baseline you can use to frame your feedback, and helps you find some things that you might want to focus on.

- **Observe your people: Y**ou can’t give feedback if you aren’t paying attention. If anything, I think the best outcome of attempting a continuous feedback cycle is not necessarily the actual feedback generated, but rather that the effort forces you to start paying attention to the individuals on your team. Good managers have a knack for identifying talents and helping people draw more out of their strengths.
- **Provide lightweight, regular feedback -** Start with +ve feedback. Positive feedback also makes your reports more likely to listen to you when you need to give them critical feedback. When they believe that their manager sees the good things they do, they’ll be more open to hearing about the areas where they might improve. It’s best to give critical feedback quickly in the case of an obvious misstep, but continuous feedback is more than in-the-moment corrections. **Bonus:** Provide coaching. Ultimately, continuous feedback works best when you as a manager pair that feedback with coaching. As situations arise, use coaching to ask people what they might have done differently. When things are going well, praise them, but also make suggestions as to what could be even better in the future. Form a partnership with your direct report where the two of you are working together to help her grow.
- **Performance Review:**  The self-reviews give you a sense of what your people believe about themselves, their strengths and weaknesses and accomplishments over the year. Writing the summary review gives you the chance to focus for longer than a few minutes on the individuals and look at the big picture over a longer period of time. All of this should help you see some patterns and trends that you might overlook in the process of day-to-day continuous feedback.

**Writing and Delivering a Performance Review** You owe your team enough time to read the collected feedback, digest it, and summarize it well. My advice is to start by reading the collected reviews and taking a few notes, processing the information for a little bit before trying to write a full summary. Give yourself enough time to write and come back to what you’ve written at least once before you have to submit the review. manager review is still often considered the most important summary of all review feedback.

- **Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months** keep a running summary of your 1-1s, including any feedback that was delivered. The goal for viewing the whole year is to recognize not just early accomplishments but also the growth and change you’ve seen since then.
- **Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths Y**ou want to celebrate achievements, talk about what’s going well, and give plenty of praise for good work. This goes not only for the writing process but also — and especially — for the delivery. Those strengths are what you’ll use to determine when people should be promoted, and it is important to write them down and reflect on them.
- **Keep areas for improvement focused**

“**There are people who:**

Struggle with saying no to distractions and end up helping with other projects instead of finishing their own

Do good work but are hard for others to work with, tending to be overly critical or rude in meetings, code reviews, or other collaborative activities

Struggle to break their work up into intermediate deliverables, and don’t balance planning and design with getting things done

Work well with other engineers but do not work well with other departments or teams

Struggle to follow the accepted best practices of the team, cut corners, or otherwise do sloppy work

When you have very little meaningful feedback for improvement? This indicates that the person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work. If the person is doing a solid job at her level but isn’t ready for promotion, the feedback should, the feedback should indicate one or two skills she needs to expand to become qualified for promotion.

**Avoid big surprises** Set expectations appropriately before reviews are delivered. If someone is underperforming across the board, the review should not be his first time getting that feedback. Similarly, if someone has recently been promoted, you may want to prepare her for the fact that she will be reviewed based on higher standards.

**Schedule enough time to discuss the review** 

Come prepared to dig into the reasons for this score, including examples of how the person could achieve a higher score.

**Is there a good way to identify potential? Does all potential look the same? What does it really mean for someone to have potential?** A person who has never shown reasonable performance, and who has been with a company long enough for you to observe performance, probably doesn’t actually have potential, at least within that company. 

Real potential shows itself quickly. It shows itself as working hard to go the extra mile, offering insightful suggestions on problems, and helping the team in areas that were previously neglected. 

## Cultivating Careers:

If you’re a manager, you are going to play a key role in getting people on your team promoted. When members express the desire to be promoted and they don’t have a strong case for promotion, telling them what goes into the process will help them understand what they may need to change. 

**Challenging situations: Firing Underperformers**

One of the basic rules of management is the rule of no surprises, particularly negative ones. You need to understand what a person is supposed to be giving you, and if that isn’t happening, make it clear to her early and often that she is not meeting expectations.

# Managing a team

Here is the job description that I used for the role of managing a team, which I called “engineering lead.

The engineering lead will spend less time writing code, but they still engage in small technical deliverables, such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of their team. More than writing code, they hold responsibility for identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team and clearing these roadblocks.

“The person who fills this role is expected to have a large impact on the success of [the organization] as a whole. In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the engineering lead will partner closely with the product lead to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met.

The engineering lead is an independent manager. They are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. 

They communicate expectations clearly to all team members, and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently

They clearly communicate the timeline, scope, and risks to their pillar partners, and lead the delivery of major initiatives on clear timelines.

**Staying Technical:**

Engineering management is a technical discipline, not just a set of people skills. Technical instincts honed over years of doing the job are very important for guiding that process.

It’s a struggle to figure out how to stay technical as you transition to management. The new responsibilities that come with being a manager — more meetings, planning, administrative tasks — don’t lend themselves to having focused time to write code. It can be hard to work out how to stay in the code when you are pulled in a million directions. Expect managers at this level to implement small features and bug fixes. 

Strong engineering managers can identify the shortest path through the systems to implement new features. As you learned in your time as a tech lead, a critical part of complex project management is understanding the pieces of the system well enough to determine the best path to implementation.

**Collaboration Problems**

You can make the situation worse by undermining your peers in front of your team, so even when you are frustrated with them, try to stay positive and supportive of their efforts in public. 

**The Shield:**

helping them understand the key important goals and focusing them on those goals is important. You may be a shield, but you are not a parent. Sometimes, in combining the roles of shield and mentor we end up in a parenting-style relationship with our team

**How to Drive Good Decisions**

You have more responsibility than you may expect. While the product manager is responsible for the product roadmap, and the tech lead is responsible for the technical details, you are usually accountable for the team’s progress through each of these elements.

**Create a data driven team culture:**

- Share data about team productivity (such as the time it takes to complete features) or data about quality measures (like how much time is spent dealing with outages, or the number of bugs found in QA or after releases).
- Taking the time to develop customer empathy is important because you’ll need to give your engineers context for their work.
- **Review the Outcome of Your Decisions and Projects** Was it true that the team moved faster after you rewrote that system? Did customer behavior change in the way the product team predicted when you added the new feature? What have you learned from your A/B tests? Learn from decisions
- **Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day**  Is the team feeling good about how they get requirements? Do they feel good about the code quality? This process helps you learn how the decisions you make over time affect the way your team operates in the day-to-day.

It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. 

**Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board** By “generic sustaining engineering work,” I mean testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, and doing other work that has to happen. Cleaning up systems as you go keeps those systems easy to work in, which keeps your teams moving forward on new features.

**As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no** 

There will be times when the engineering team will say that they can’t possibly implement a feature without doing some other technical work, and you will need to figure out when to push for a hack implementation and when to hold back for the right implementation.

**Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks**

**Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate** 

As the manager, you’re responsible for handling uncertainty and limiting how much of that uncertainty you expose to your team. 

**Ask the CTO: Joining a Small Team** 

There are a few ways to get into the software without annoying the team. First, get someone to walk you through the systems and architecture, as well as the process for testing and releasing the software. If there is a normal developer onboarding process where you learn how to check out code and deploy the systems, go through that process. Spend some time getting comfortable in the code bases, and start watching the code reviews or pull requests, if they exist.  Plan to work on at least a couple of features in your first 60 days. Take a specced-out feature and add it. Pair with one of the engineers on a feature he’s working on, and have him pair with you as you start working on a feature of your own. Get your code reviewed by a member of the team. Perform a release, and do a rotation of supporting the systems for at least a couple of days if support is part of the team’s responsibilities.  By getting to know the code, the processes for writing code, and the tools and systems your team use for their day-to-day, you will gain the understanding necessary for managing the team, and the technical credibility necessary for them to see you as a capable leader.

**Assessing Your Own Experience**

- What are your new responsibilities now that you’re the manager of a team? What tasks have you stopped doing or handed off to someone else in order to make time for these new responsibilities?
- How well do you feel you know the day-to-day challenges of writing, deploying, and supporting code on your team?
- How often does your team mark work as completed?
- When was the last time you wrote a feature, debugged a problem, or paired with a member of your team on some code he or she was struggling with?”
- How does your team make decisions? Do you have a process for assigning decision-making responsibility? What decisions do you hold yourself responsible for making?
- When was the last time you reviewed a completed project to see if it had achieved its goals?
- ***How well does your team understand why they are working on the projects they are working on?***
- When was the last time you cut scope on a project? What did you use to determine which pieces to cut?

# Managing Multiple Teams

The engineering director is responsible for a significant area of the technology team. The engineering director typically leads engineers across multiple product areas, or multiple technology functions. Both tech leads and individual contributors report into them. The engineering director is not generally expected to write code on a day-to-day basis. However, the engineering director is responsible for the organization’s overall technical competence, guiding and growing that competence in the whole team as necessary via training and hiring. They should have a strong technical background and spend some of their time researching new technologies and staying abreast of trends in the tech industry. They should contribute to architecture and design efforts primarily by serving as the technically savvy voice that asks business and product questions of the engineers on their teams, ensuring that the code we are writing matches the product and business needs and can scale appropriately as those needs grow. The engineering director is primarily concerned with ensuring smooth execution of complex deliverables. They are the leaders for recruiting, headcount management and planning, career growth and training for the organization. 

They are responsible for creating and growing the next generation of leadership and management talent in the organization, and helping that talent learn how to balance technical and people leadership and management. They are obsessed with creating high-functioning, engaged, and motivated organizations, and they are expected to own retention goals within their organization. engineering directors are responsible for strategically balancing immediate and long-term product-/business-focused work with technical debt and strategic technical development. The director is a very strong communicator who can both simplify technical concepts to explain them to nontechnical partners and explain business direction to the technology team in a way that inspires and guides them. Directors of engineering help to create a positive public presence for Rent the Runway tech and are capable of selling the company and their area to potential candidates.

“Finally, even if you don’t intend to write much code, I strongly advise you to keep at least a solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings or other obligations, and try to use this time at least partially on some creative pursuit. You might write blog posts for your engineering blog, prepare conference talks, or participate in an open source project. Do something to scratch that creative itch, which can otherwise be hard for you to scratch as a manager.

Becoming a great manager requires you to focus on the skills of management, and that requires giving up some of your technical focus. It’s a tradeoff, and one you’ll have to decide if you’re up to making.

### **Managing Your Time: What’s Important, Anyway?**

Read **Getting things done book**

Managing your time comes down to one important thing: understanding the difference between importance and urgency.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/341017ef-42fb-4332-8fc3-d31d3715d5b7/ebecb5a3-7d9e-4387-b5b7-9f9eeed277f0/Untitled.png)

If it’s important and urgent, you’re doing it. 

The responsibility of keeping your teams successfully moving forward and happily engaged is on your shoulders.

**Delegate Simple and Frequent Tasks**

If the task is simple and frequent, find someone to whom you can hand it off. Examples of simple and frequent tasks might include running daily standups, writing up a summary of the teams’ progress each week, or conducting minor code reviews. Your tech leads or other senior engineers can take responsibility for these tasks and probably won’t even need training to do so.

**Handle Simple and Infrequent Tasks Yourself**

If it’s faster to do something yourself than it would be to explain it to someone else and it rarely needs to be done, roll up your sleeves and do it, even if you deem the task beneath you. This can be anything from booking the occasional conference ticket for your team to running the script that generates quarterly reports.

**Use Complex and Infrequent Tasks as Training Opportunities for Rising Leaders**

Tasks like writing performance reviews and making hiring plans are yours alone. However, these are also the skills you will want to pass on to rising managers. You may have a tech lead sit with you to write the performance review for an intern, or have a senior engineer provide feedback on how many new people he believes would be needed to support a project next year. Ask for help from above on these tasks until you feel comfortable doing them, but once you feel comfortable, start pulling in rising leaders to learn how they are done.

Start mastering the “yes, and” strategy for saying no, particularly when interacting with your boss and peers, and see how it often transforms contentious disagreements into realistic negotiations for priority.

**Measuring the Health of Your Development Team**

When you’re focusing on the health of your development teams, put on your technical hat to design systems and processes that will keep things moving. Create the tools that developers need to do their jobs. Help them focus so they can easily figure out what needs to happen next. Interrogate every process to determine the value it should provide, and always ask yourself if it can be automated further. Consider these ways to measure the health of your team.

**Assessing Your Own Experience**

When was the last time you reviewed your schedule for things that you’re doing but that aren’t providing a lot of value for you or your team? Look back on the past couple of weeks. Look forward to the next couple of weeks. What did you accomplish, and what do you hope to accomplish?

If you are still writing code, how does this fit in with the rest of your schedule? Are you doing it after hours? What’s driving you to continue to spend this time?

What was the last task you delegated to a member of one of your teams? Was it simple or complex? How is the person you delegated to handling the new task?

Who are the rising leaders of your teams? What is your plan for coaching them to take on bigger leadership roles? What tasks are you giving them to prepare them for more responsibility?

Does the process of writing, releasing, and supporting code seem to function smoothly on your teams? When was the last time there was a noticeable incident with part of this process? What happened, and how did the team respond to it? How often does the[…]”

As you manage managers, you’ll ultimately evaluate them on the performance of their teams.

manager is accountable for the health and productivity of the team.

**Managing New Managers**

Running 1-1s, for example, is an intimidating experience the first time you do it. What do you talk about? How do you give feedback? How do you keep track of takeaways? No book or training can replace you spending some time asking your new manager how her 1-1s are going, and seeing what questions or challenges she may need help with.

Use skip-level meetings to help you detect areas where you need to support your new manager fully.

First-time managers are tricky because if they truly don’t have the willingness to learn and aptitude to become solid managers, they’re a big problem. Making the wrong person a manager is a mistake, but keeping her in that position once you’ve realize she’s wrong for it is a critical error. I am hugely in favor of making engineers who wish to go into management take baby steps of mentoring and managing very small teams, but this is not always possible and doesn’t always shake out problems that come with scale. Control freak managers, for example, don’t often show up as clearly in smaller management situations, instead holding that impulse back until they feel they have the true authority of title. Keep an eye on your new managers. You may need to provide not only coaching but strong corrective feedback in the first six months.

**Managing experienced managers**

“There is a reason that many young companies want to seed their management teams with people who’ve been there from the early days and understand the company’s DNA. They get the culture, they understand deeply what is important, and they have the internal networks already built to get things done.

**Hiring Managers:**

Manager skills should be a culture match for your organization. 1-1s are an essential tool for a manager to determine the health of her team and gather and impart valuable information. 

One of the best ways to do this is by asking the people who would report to the new manager to interview her by asking her to help with problems they have right now, or have had in the recent past. Similar to a senior engineer being asked how he might approach debugging an issue that you just resolved, a good manager — even without a full understanding of the people or projects involved — should have good instincts for questions to ask and suggested next steps that might improve matters.

Ask the manager to describe how she’s coached employees who were struggling, and helped great employees grow to new levels.

What does she think the job of a manager is? How does she stay hands-on, and how does she delegate?

**Ask the CTO:**

Make it clear to the person that your goal is to understand what she does so that you’re capable of appreciating it better.

Grit your teeth and make the time to get comfortable with each area; take time to get to know the manager and employees in the team, and practice asking for details about the area, so that you can start to learn and develop a sense for what the people in that team are actually doing.

Managing teams is a series of complex black boxes interacting with other complex black boxes.

**Observe the team:**

Good meetings have a heavy discussion element, where opinions and ideas are drawn out of the team. 

Another core element of agile software development is the emphasis on learning from the past. When estimates are wrong, what are we learning about unknown complexity?

**Challenging Situations: Roadmap Uncertainty**

“Strategies for Handling Roadmap Uncertainty

- Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” This means allowing time for refactoring, fixing outstanding bugs, improving engineering processes, doing minor cleanup, and providing ongoing support.
- Without that 20% time, there will be negative consequences with missed delivery goals and unplanned and unpleasant cleanup work.
- Understand how important various engineering projects really are.
    - How big is that project?
    - How important is it?
    - Can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks?
    - What would successful completion of the project mean for the team?

The value of these questions is that you start to treat big technical projects the same way as product initiatives. These projects have advocates and goals, they have schedules, and they are managed like other big initiatives. This is a scary process because there are times when you “know” something is important, but you don’t know how to articulate it in a way that the business will value. Especially given the complex nature of technical projects and the challenge of measuring things like engineering efficiency, you’re sometimes stuck trying to explain technical details to a nontechnical partner who may not totally understand where you’re going or why

Especially given the complex nature of technical projects and the challenge of measuring things like engineering efficiency, you’re sometimes stuck trying to explain technical details to a nontechnical partner who may not totally understand where you’re going or why.

**Staying Technically Relevant**

**Analyze and Explain Engineering and Business Tradeoffs:** You ensure that engineers make decisions with an understanding of the business perspective and the future of the product roadmap. When technical work requires uncertain research and development, you’re capable of explaining why that uncertainty exists to your nontechnical counterparts.

**Use Your Experience as a Gut Check**

Given your level of technical responsibility, how should you invest your time in order to stay technically relevant?

**Read the code.** Occasionally taking the time to read some of the code in your systems can help remind you what it looks like. Sometimes, it also shows you places where things have gotten ugly and need attention. Looking over code reviews and pull requests can give you insight into changes that are happening.

**Pick an unknown area,** and ask an engineer to explain it to you. Spend a couple of hours with one of the engineers who is working on something you don’t understand, and ask him to teach you about that area. Go to a whiteboard or share a screen and have him pair with you on a small change.

**Attend postmortems** 

“Attend postmortems. When outages happen, make it a priority to attend the post-outage debriefs. These meetings are often full of details about the process of writing and deploying software that you miss when you aren’t coding every day. Standards that you thought were obvious have been neglected or ignored. Communication between teams is lacking, and tooling is hurting more than it is helping. In times of failure you can most clearly see where problems have built up, and you learn where your attention is needed

**Foster a network of technical people outside of your company.** The best stories are the ones that come from people you trust. Keeping up a network of peers in engineering and engineering management gives you people to ask for opinions on new trends. Use this network to get the real experiences behind the blog posts, talks, and sales pitches for new technology.

**Never stop learning**. Find articles and blog posts about technology and read them. Watch talks. Pick something you’re really curious about and dig in a little bit deeper, even if it isn’t relevant to your team or company. Don’t be afraid to ask questions of your team and look for opportunities to learn from them. Learning is a skill that you can practice to keep your mind sharp.

How are you merging product goals (if any) with the technical goals? 

## The Big Leagues:

You’re capable of making hard decisions without perfect information and willing to face the consequences of those decisions.

Management Task is:

- **Information gathering or information sharing**

Sitting in meetings, reading and writing emails, talking to people one on one, gathering perspectives. The strong senior leader is capable of synthesizing large quantities of information quickly, identifying critical elements of that information, and sharing the information with the appropriate third parties in a way they will be able to understand.

- **Nudging**

Reminding people of their commitments by asking questions instead of giving orders. It’s hard for a leader of a large team to forcefully guide that team in any direction, so instead rely on nudging members of the team to keep the overall organization on track.”

- **Decision making**

Taking conflicting perspectives and incomplete information and setting a direction, knowing that the consequences of a poor decision will impact both you and possibly the whole team. If making decisions were easy, there would be much less need for managers and leaders. However, as anyone who has spent a lot of time managing can tell you, making decisions is one of the most draining and stressful parts of the job.

- **Role modeling**

Showing people what the values of the company are. Showing up for your commitments. Setting the best example for the team even when you don’t feel like it.

my role was to help the team make the best possible decisions and help them implement them in a sustainable and efficient way.

## **Ruling with Fear, Guiding with Trust**

Camille considers herself to be a good leader: technical, charismatic, capable of making decisions and getting things done. She’s also sometimes short-tempered, and when people don’t live up to her expectations or things go wrong, she can be visibly annoyed and openly angry. She doesn’t realize that this hard edge and short temper are making people afraid of her. They don’t want to risk getting blamed for failure or openly criticized for making a mistake, so they take fewer risks and hide their mistakes. Camille has accidentally created a culture of fear.

Michael is also a good leader: technical, charismatic, capable of making decisions and getting things done. He’s also good at keeping his cool. Instead of getting tense and angry, he gets curious when things don’t seem to be going well. His first instinct is to ask questions, and these questions often cause the team to come to their own realizations about what’s going wrong.

Even those who love you on your team admit being fearful of you and your potential criticism. People are afraid to take risks or fail in front of you because they are scared of being publicly reprimanded in front of their peers. What your attacks have done is create a culture where members of the team are afraid to engage with you, to ask you questions, or to ask you for feedback — which then leads to a vicious cycle of you not trusting them and them making mistakes.

How do you know if you’re creating a culture of fear? It can come from placing a high value on being correct and following the rules, and having a strong affinity for hierarchy-based leadership. I also believe that coming from places where conflict was openly tolerated, if not actively encouraged, made me even more likely to create this culture. Engineering culture has a high tolerance for open debate to resolve conflict, so leaders who come from heavily engineering-focused backgrounds may feel particularly comfortable aggressively sparring with others over issues. Unfortunately, when you’re the leader, the dynamic changes, and those who may have fought back when you were an individual contributor will feel threatened by you as a leader.

**Correcting a Culture of Fear**

I had a habit of focusing too much on efficiency.

If you want a team that feels comfortable taking risks and making mistakes, one of the core requirements is a sense of belonging and safety. This means you need to take a little time for small talk. Ask people about themselves, get to know them as humans, let them know you. Most people are scared to take risks in front of people they think will reject them if they fail. Intentionally or not, by neglecting to create even basic personal relationships with many of my team members, I made them afraid of how I would react to mistakes, questions, and failures.

**Get curious. When you disagree with something, stop to ask why.**

Not every disagreement is an undermining of your authority. When you take the time to seek out more information about something with which you disagree, you’ll often find that you were reacting to something you didn’t really understand. For those of us who care about doing the right thing or making the best decision, attacking something we disagree with makes that harder.

When you get curious and learn how to turn that disagreement into honest questioning, you can learn more about other perspectives on the issue because your team will open up. This is how you get the most information out and help everyone make the best decisions.

**Learn how to hold people accountable without making them bad:**

Learn how to hold people accountable without making them bad. As a leader, you want your teams to do their jobs well. If they fail to meet their responsibilities, you’ll be the person to hold them accountable. But it doesn’t start with responsibility and end with consequences. Other elements are needed along the way. How do you measure success? Does the team have the capabilities needed to succeed? Are you providing feedback along the way? I think many leaders forget these requirements and hope they can get a junior team to achieve something just by setting the goal clearly, or believe a more experienced team shouldn’t ever need feedback. Think of the times you’ve made a person or a team out to be “bad” because they failed. Are you holding yourself accountable for setting them up for success? When everything is clear and you’ve all done your best, I bet you’ll find that accountability comes with far less character judgment, because you all clearly see what has happened. practice caring about your team as humans, and get curious. Building a culture of trust takes time, but the results are well worth it.

leaders rely on the wisdom they’ve developed over time to make fast decisions when they don’t have time to delve into all the details.

Bootstrapping culture:

Instead of talking about structure, I talk about learning. Instead of talking about process, I talk about transparency. We don’t set up systems because structure and process have inherent value. We do it because we want to learn from our successes and our mistakes, and to share those successes and encode the lessons we learn from failures in a transparent way. This learning and sharing is how organizations become more stable and more scalable over time.

My advice to leaders is simple: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. The patterns you see are opportunities to evolve your structure, either by creating more or different structure or removing it. Think about how often the failure happens and its cost, and use your best judgment about the changes that need to be made. Using failure to guide evolution lets you apply structure at the right level. If a failure is occurring in only one part of the system — say, on one team — you can try to address the structure on that team without necessarily changing the larger structure. What about examining success? 

**Creating your culture:**

Consciously guiding the culture of your team is part of a leader’s job, and to do this well, you need to understand what it means in the first place.

Applying Core Values:

We explicitly valued diversity. That meant that we were more interested in what you could do and what your potential was than having you fit a certain set of checkboxes in the screening process. We layered a learning culture on top of our company values, because we believed that this was important for us as engineers. 

One of the most important uses of performance reviews is to evaluate the alignment between team members’ values and the company’s values, and therefore what values should be part of your performance review process.

Call out when and how people exhibit some of the core values of the team. This practice reinforces desired behavior in a positive way.

It also gives you a sense of who on your team exhibits most or all of the values, and who does not.

Using the core values to coach people in areas where they are misaligned can help you articulate what otherwise may feel like just ambiguous friction.

Learn to spot people who have values conflicts with the company or team. If your company has a value of “roll up your sleeves and get involved,” the teammate who continually pushes off work to others is not truly following this value of the company. If you have a value of “happiness and positivity is a choice,” the teammate who pooh-poohs every idea and criticizes everything is going to have problems fitting in. Sometimes, people will change to adopt the values. “Happiness and positivity is a choice” is actually one of the core values of Rent the Runway, and I would not say that I came from a work background of happiness.

Understand what your company’s values are, understand what your team’s values are, and think about what you personally value. Write the values down if they aren’t already written, and try to be explicit. Use this explicit list to evaluate candidates, praise team members, and inform your performance review process

## **Creating Cultural Policy:**

My first ladder was a flop because my team needed more details. The goal of the lightweight ladder was to keep the team from obsessing over their levels and promotion, but instead the lack of detail caused many of them to obsess even more. Engineers argued that they deserved to be at higher levels because the details were vague. It caused a constant series of headaches.

**Writing a Career Ladder:**

**Solicit participation from your team.:**

- I asked people to highlight things they didn’t understand. I asked them to propose rewrites, additions, edits, and details. We discussed it as a group, and we had subgroups work on the parts of the ladder that they cared about most. For example, the most senior individual contributors worked on the technical and skills expectations for the individual contributor levels.
- Look for examples
- Be detailed. One of the biggest challenges you’ll face when writing a good ladder is sketching out the details. You want something that is inspirational and descriptive but that matches your company.
- Use both long-form descriptions and summaries.
- How many levels should your ladder have? You’ll need to answer two more questions to figure this one out. First, how do you pay people? And second, how do you recognize achievement?
- Consider how the ladder relates to salary. Your HR department will want to use the career ladder to help set salary expectations. Usually, each level will have a salary band, or a range between a minimum and maximum base salary that a person in the level can earn. If you don’t have many levels, you’ll need to have very wide salary bands to account for the fact that two people within that level can perform very differently, and to account for the fact that engineers tend to expect to get salary increases frequently, especially in the earlier parts of their careers.
- Use narrow salary bands for early-career stages. Lots of levels and narrow salary bands mean that you can promote people quickly and justify giving them raises while keeping your pay for all people at a certain level close to the same. This is good if you are worried about paying fairly and avoiding bias that might lead you to, say, pay men more than women at the same level. Unfortunately, it’s incredibly hard to create enough detail between close levels to allow a person to easily distinguish someone being at one level or another.
- Use wide salary bands when and where you have fewer levels. Wide salary bands and few levels make a clearer distinction between the skills at each level, and should make it easier to tell who is operating at which level. In the case of widely spaced levels, you want to have large salary bands and you want those salary bands to overlap. So, a software engineer band may go $50–100K, and a senior software engineer band may go $80–150K. That means a strong software engineer may make more than a senior engineer. You need this wiggle room to retain talent who are on the fence into the lower level with the expectation that they will be promoted quickly.
- Recognize achievement. Some companies want to keep levels secret, but that tends to be impossible. People will talk. However, you can go out of your way to emphasize certain levels while keeping other levels secret, possibly even from the employees themselves. Some HR departments have separate pay grade numbers that they use to track employee pay that are disconnected from career ladders entirely. I am not advocating for this. However, I do encourage you to have at least some of your levels be keystone promotions, which are shared and celebrated. I think that the promotion to senior engineer is a big deal, as well as the promotion to staff engineer and, if you have such a role, principal engineer. On the management track, a promotion to director is worth celebrating, as is a promotion to VP. Having keystone levels that are not too close together gives people a bigger achievement to strive for beyond the next pay increase, and keeps these levels feeling important from a larger career standpoint.
- Consider making people management skills a mid-career requirement. Encourage everyone to have some sort of management or mentorship experience before they are eligible to be promoted above the level of the track split. For most companies, the tracks should split when people start to exhibit leadership, whether that leadership involves managing humans or designing software. But even when designing software, you’re dealing with other humans and human needs. Great senior individual contributors still know how to manage projects and mentor more junior members of their team, so consider making leadership experience (usually via acting as a tech lead) a requirement for promotion to senior individual contributor levels.
- Years of experience:  It takes a lot of individual maturity to think through large projects, which is, in my view, the distinguishing feature of a staff engineer. Being a brilliant programmer is not enough to be a great staff engineer; you need to have shown a track record of completing and supporting some long-running work to justify this title. You don’t have to put years of experience as a strict requirement for levels, but consider having some rules of thumb, especially if you are writing a ladder for the first time and rolling out levels.
- Don’t be afraid to evolve over time.

## Structuring Cross-Functional Teams

Engineers were managed by engineering managers and reported in to me. Product managers reported to the head of product. Even with a dedicated infrastructure group, the engineers assigned to product pods still need some time to account for engineering-specific tasks like on-call, interviewing, and sustaining engineering (aka technical debt). I advise reserving 20% of all engineering time for such work, based purely on my personal experience and the experience of my peers in engineering management.

In technology-focused structures where engineers work solely with other engineers, particularly engineers of their same “type” (mobile, backend, middleware, etc.), the focus is on being the best engineer by some measure of engineering excellence. People who design complex systems or who know the details of the latest iOS are the leaders and role models for the teams. In a product-focused structure, the leadership focus changes. Now the engineers who have the best product sense, the engineers who are capable of getting features done quickly and efficiently, and the engineers who communicate the best with the other functions will start to emerge as the leaders of the team.

## Developing Engineering Processes

Engineering processes are the place where the rubber meets the road when it comes to structure. Career ladders, values, team structures — all of those are easy compared to the general furstration.

Balancing the current size and risk tolerance of your team with the processes at hand is the essence of guiding good software development and operational guidelines.

Think of process as risk management

## Practical Advice: Depersonalize Decision Making

- Code Review
- The Outage postmortem
- Architecture Review

The more time you spend understanding yourself, the way you react, the things that inspire you, and the things that drive you crazy, the better off you will be. 

Apply that curiosity to people. Apply it to process. Apply it to technology, and strategy, and business. Ask questions, and be willing to have your notions proven wrong.

Stay curious, and good luck on your path!

**Critical Thinking:**

A way of questioning and challenging assumptions.
