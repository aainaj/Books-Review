Relevance of  prayer: When you pray “you transcend your body and become a part of the cosmos, which knows no division
of wealth, age, caste, or creed.” 

Every human being is a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine
Being. So why be afraid of difficulties, sufferings and problems? When troubles come, try to understand the
relevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presents opportunities for introspection.
"Whenever human beings find themselves alone, as a natural reaction, they start looking for company. Whenever
they are in trouble, they look for someone to help them. Whenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone to
show them the way out. Every recurrent anguish, longing, and desire finds its own special helper. For the people who
come to me in distress, I am but a go-between in their effort to propitiate demonic forces with prayers and offerings.
This is not a correct approach at all and should never be followed. One must understand the difference between a
fear-ridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables us
to seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves."

There exists a divine power that can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy and failure, and guide one to one’s true place. And once an
individual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he is on the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind.

“To succeed in life and achieve
results, you must understand and master three mighty
forces— desire, belief, and expectation.” “With faith, you can change your destiny,” he would say.

Evoke people to “enjoy the action of giving”

. Why aeronautics? Why not electrical engineering? Why not mechanical engineering? I myself would like to tell all novitiate engineering students that when they choose
their specialization, the essential point to consider is whether the choice articulates their inner feelings and
aspirations.

“Let God be your hope, your stay, your guide and provide
the lantern for your feet in your journey into the future,” said
the introverted genius, bidding me adieu.

Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it
is pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic energy. This energy is released into the ether each night, as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning it
returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic
currents. That which has been imaged will surely and
certainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this ageless promise as surely as you can rely upon the
eternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear—
How true! Here was the teacher to show the way to a
student who had nearly gone astray! “Accept your destiny and go ahead with your life. You are not destined to
become an Air Force pilot. What you are destined to
become is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget
this failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destined
path. Search, instead, for the true purpose of your existence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrender yourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.




In My Words:
- When you pray you leave your body and become a part of cosmos which doesn't discriminate people. When we fail in life, we blame our destiny. We never try to find our inner faults of character. We shouldn't accept that vision of destiny caused by fear, rather we should accept a vision that helps us to find out the enemy of fulfillment within ourselves. If we can seek reasons of failures  within ourself then we can conquer our suffering or failures.
One should follow a routine, have life fundamentals. There exists a divine power in the universe which can guide one in correct direction. Once a person can separate his emotional and physical bondage, he is on the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind. Once you decide to change the system, be ready to confront with problems. Current place may be housing your body but not your soul. Parents just have to make sure that the children are getting the right resources for their complete development. That’s all. Parents thoughts should end there. Selfishly wanting to make children do something is not the duty of the parents. They have no right to impose their thoughts on them. When the soul chooses its mortal/human parents, it is not sure about how the future will unveil. So, it’s up to the parents to recognize the soul within a child and secure what is already written. 

Parents provide the nourishment that is needed for the body of a child. They keep the house tidy and healthy thus the soul can reside inside it without any problems. They should not think that they are housing souls as the supreme creator protects it. They nourish the external environment that is needed for the overall development of the spiritual self of a child.

According to the god, every soul has the same house, this place is referred to as “the house of tomorrow.” It hints at the place where the soul merges after the body expires. This house cannot be visited as each soul has specific spots to fill in. Parents’ souls have their respective places in the divine spirit. A human being cannot even dream of that place. It is only unveiled after bodily death.

To succeed in one's life, one need to master 3 forces i.e. desire, belief and expectation. You can aspire to beome whatever you wish. With faith, you can change your destiny. You can know lots about others but a person who knows himself can be a much greater thing than wise. Not only will you be Wise but you will understand the true joy of life and how your greatest friend and enemy is yourself. Let not thy winged days be spent in vain. When once gone, no gold can buy them back. Let god be your hope, your stay, your guide & provide the lantern for your feet in your journey into the future.
