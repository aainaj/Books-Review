Relevance of  prayer: When you pray “you transcend your body and become a part of the cosmos, which knows no division
of wealth, age, caste, or creed.” 

Every human being is a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine
Being. So why be afraid of difficulties, sufferings and problems? When troubles come, try to understand the
relevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presents opportunities for introspection.
"Whenever human beings find themselves alone, as a natural reaction, they start looking for company. Whenever
they are in trouble, they look for someone to help them. Whenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone to
show them the way out. Every recurrent anguish, longing, and desire finds its own special helper. For the people who
come to me in distress, I am but a go-between in their effort to propitiate demonic forces with prayers and offerings.
This is not a correct approach at all and should never be followed. One must understand the difference between a
fear-ridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables us
to seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves."

There exists a divine power that can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy and failure, and guide one to one’s true place. And once an
individual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he is on the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind.
